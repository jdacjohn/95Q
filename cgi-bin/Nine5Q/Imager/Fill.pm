=head1 NAME

  Imager::Fill - general fill types

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $fill1 = Imager::Fill->new(solid=>$color, combine=>$combine);
  my $fill2 = Imager::Fill->new(hatch=>'vline2', fg=>$color1, bg=>$color2,
                                dx=>$dx, dy=>$dy);
  my $fill3 = Imager::Fill->new(fountain=>$type, ...);
  my $fill4 = Imager::Fill->new(image=>$img, ...);

=head1 DESCRIPTION 

Creates fill objects for use by some drawing functions, currently just
the Imager box() method.

The currently available fills are:

=over

=item *

solid

=item *

hatch

=item *

fountain (similar to gradients in paint software)

=back

=head1 Common options

=over

=item combine

The way in which the fill data is combined with the underlying image,
possible values include:

=over

=item none

The fill pixel replaces the target pixel.

=item normal

The fill pixels alpha value is used to combine it with the target pixel.

=item multiply

=item mult

Each channel of fill and target is multiplied, and the result is
combined using the alpha channel of the fill pixel.

=item dissolve

If the alpha of the fill pixel is greater than a random number, the
fill pixel is alpha combined with the target pixel.

=item add

The channels of the fill and target are added together, clamped to the range of the samples and alpha combined with the target.

=item subtract

The channels of the fill are subtracted from the target, clamped to be
>= 0, and alpha combined with the target.

=item diff

The channels of the fill are subtracted from the target and the
absolute value taken this is alpha combined with the target.

=item lighten

The higher value is taken from each channel of the fill and target
pixels, which is then alpha combined with the target.

=item darken

The higher value is taken from each channel of the fill and target
pixels, which is then alpha combined with the target.

=item hue

The combination of the saturation and value of the target is combined
with the hue of the fill pixel, and is then alpha combined with the
target.

=item sat

The combination of the hue and value of the target is combined
with the saturation of the fill pixel, and is then alpha combined with the
target.

=item value

The combination of the hue and value of the target is combined
with the value of the fill pixel, and is then alpha combined with the
target.

=item color

The combination of the value of the target is combined with the hue
and saturation of the fill pixel, and is then alpha combined with the
target.

=back

=back

In general colors can be specified as Imager::Color or
Imager::Color::Float objects.  The fill object will typically store
both types and convert from one to the other.  If a fill takes 2 color
objects they should have the same type.

=head2 Solid fills

  my $fill = Imager::Fill->new(solid=>$color, $combine =>$combine)

Creates a solid fill, the only required parameter is C<solid> which
should be the color to fill with.

=head2 Hatched fills

  my $fill = Imager::Fill->new(hatch=>$type, fg=>$fgcolor, bg=>$bgcolor,
                               dx=>$dx, $dy=>$dy);

Creates a hatched fill.  You can specify the following keywords:

=over

=item hatch

The type of hatch to perform, this can either be the numeric index of
the hatch (not recommended), the symbolic name of the hatch, or an
array of 8 integers which specify the pattern of the hatch.

Hatches are represented as cells 8x8 arrays of bits, which limits their
complexity.

Current hatch names are:

=over

=item check1x1, check2x2, check4x4

checkerboards at varios sizes

=item vline1, vline2, vline4

1, 2, or 4 vertical lines per cell

=item hline1, hline2, hline4

1, 2, or 4 horizontal lines per cell

=item slash1,  slash2

1 or 2 / lines per cell.

=item slosh1,  slosh2

1 or 2 \ lines per cell

=item grid1,  grid2,  grid4

1, 2, or 4 vertical and horizontal lines per cell

=item dots1, dots4, dots16

1, 4 or 16 dots per cell

=item stipple, stipple2

see the samples

=item weave

I hope this one is obvious.

=item cross1,  cross2

2 densities of crosshatch

=item vlozenge,  hlozenge

something like lozenge tiles

=item scalesdown,  scalesup,  scalesleft,  scalesright

Vaguely like fish scales in each direction.

=item tile_L

L-shaped tiles

=back

=item fg

=item bg

The fg color is rendered where bits are set in the hatch, and the bg
where they are clear.  If you use a transparent fg or bg, and set
combine, you can overlay the hatch onto an existing image.

fg defaults to black, bg to white.

=item dx

=item dy

An offset into the hatch cell.  Both default to zero.

=back

You can call Imager::Fill->hatches for a list of hatch names.

=head2 Fountain fills

  my $fill = Imager::Fill->new(fountain=>$ftype, 
       xa=>$xa, ya=>$ya, xb=>$xb, yb=>$yb, 
       segment=>$segments, repeat=>$repeat, combine=>$combine, 
       super_sample=>$super_sample, ssample_param=>$ssample_param);

This fills the given region with a fountain fill.  This is exactly the
same fill as the C<fountain> filter, but is restricted to the shape
you are drawing, and the fountain parameter supplies the fill type,
and is required.

=head2 Image Fills

  my $fill = Imager::Fill->new(image=>$src, xoff=>$xoff, yoff=>$yoff,
                               matrix=>$matrix, $combine);

Fills the given image with a tiled version of the given image.  The
first non-zero value of xoff or yoff will provide an offset along the
given axis between rows or columns of tiles respectively.

The matrix parameter performs a co-ordinate transformation from the
co-ordinates in the target image to the fill image co-ordinates.
Linear interpolation is used to determine the fill pixel.  You can use
the L<Imager::Matrix2d> class to create transformation matrices.

The matrix parameter will significantly slow down the fill.

=head1 OTHER METHODS

=over

=item Imager::Fill->hatches

A list of all defined hatch names.

=item Imager::Fill->combines

A list of all combine types.

=back

=head1 FUTURE PLANS

I'm planning on adding the following types of fills:

=over

=item checkerboard

combines 2 other fills in a checkerboard

=item combine

combines 2 other fills using the levels of an image

=item regmach

uses the transform2() register machine to create fills

=back
